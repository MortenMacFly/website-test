There are different ways to download and install Code::Blocks on your computer:

* ### [Download the binary release](/downloads/binaries)

  This is the easy way for installing Code::Blocks. Download the setup file, run it on your computer and Code::Blocks will be installed, ready for you to work with it. Can't get any easier than that!

  * ### Download a nightly build

    There are also more recent so-called nightly builds available in the [forums](http://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php/board,20.0.html). Please note that we consider nightly builds to be stable, usually, unless stated otherwise.  
  * Other distributions usually follow provided by the community (big "Thank you!" for that!). If you want to provide some, make sure to announce in the forums such that we can put it on the official C::B homepage.

* ### [Download the source code](/downloads/source)

  If you feel comfortable building applications from source, then this is the recommend way to download Code::Blocks. Downloading the source code and building it yourself puts you in great control and also makes it easier for you to update to newer versions or, even better, create patches for bugs you may find and contributing them back to the community so everyone benefits.

* ### [Retrieve source code from SVN](/downloads/svn)

  This option is the most flexible of all but requires a little bit more work to setup. It gives you that much more flexibility though because you get access to any bug-fixing we do at the time we do it. No need to wait for the next stable release to benefit from bug-fixes!  
Besides Code::Blocks itself, you can compile extra plugins from contributors to extend its functionality.

Thank you for your interest in downloading Code::Blocks!
