### The free C/C++ and Fortran IDE.

Code::Blocks is a free C/C++ and Fortran IDE built to meet the most demanding needs of its users. It is designed to be very extensible and fully configurable.

Finally, an IDE with all the features you need, having a consistent look, feel and operation across platforms.

Built around a plugin framework, Code::Blocks can be extended with plugins. Any kind of functionality can be added by installing/coding a plugin. For instance, compiling and debugging functionality is already provided by plugins!

If you 're new here, you can read the [user manual](/user-manual) or visit the [Wiki](http://wiki.codeblocks.org) for documentation.
And don't forget to visit and join our [forums](http://forums.codeblocks.org) to find help or general discussion about Code::Blocks.

Special credits go to darmar for his great work on the FortranProject plugin, bundled since release 13.12.

We hope you enjoy using Code::Blocks!
