We are very happy to announce that the process of migrating to the new infrastructure has completed successfully!
<!--more-->

Everything went flawlessly, surprisingly enough!

That's not to say we did not expect so but, usually, theory and practice can be quite different things.
Thankfully though, everything went according to plan.

We don't anticipate any major problems. We 'll be monitoring the new services and if anything comes up, we will do our best to fix it as soon as possible.

Enjoy our new home!
