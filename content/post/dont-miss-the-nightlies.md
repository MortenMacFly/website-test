We are well alive and kicking! Please remember, that while waiting for the next release, you can try new features by using the "nightlies" that we provide [here](http://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php/board,20.0.html) (downloads are on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/Nightlies/), as usual). We also provide nightly "setups" for windows for those, who like and/or need installer.
