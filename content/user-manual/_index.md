There's an on-going effort to write a user manual for Code::Blocks. This is a community-driven project and contributions/criticism/suggestions are welcomed.

The initial documentation had started as an internal project of [HighTec EDV-Systeme GmbH](https://www.hightec-rt.com) who is now making it yet another contribution to the community. Further contributions esp. for the French version were provided by [gd_on](https://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2422).

The documentation is provided in English and French languages, in PDF, CHM and HTML formats. More formats and languages may become available.

For the current versions please choose:

 * [English manual, PDF format](/docs/manual_codeblocks_en.pdf)
 * [English manual, chm format](/docs/manual_codeblocks_en.chm)
 * [English manual, HTML format](/docs/main_codeblocks_en.html)

 * [French manual, PDF format](/docs/manual_codeblocks_fr.pdf)
 * [French manual, chm format](/docs/manual_codeblocks_fr.chm)
 * [French manual, HTML format](/docs/main_codeblocks_fr.html)

The documentation is written in [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) and can be retrieved from SVN using the address: https://svn.code.sf.net/p/codeblocks/code/docs.

Any addition or translation is welcome - please contact the developers through the forum.
